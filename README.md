# yt-video-rating
Since YouTube has decided to remove the dislike counter we have no choice to check the whether the video is good or just clickbait or completely BS. The only way now left is to go to the comments and then check the comments to get the overall "rating" of the video. What if there was a counter that you could look and get the perceived "rating" of the video in a glance, well this extension is built just for that.


Although right now i am jsut learning to create extension so its not fully done yet.
